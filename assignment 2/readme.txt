Application Class
This class was useless to us, because we have everything in the game class. The render method, FOV and keyboard input are in the game class (our application class). 

Extra instructions
The FOV int is in the game class, its max is 179, but that causes the screen to get too wide. But it works ;)

Bonus exercises 
We haven't implemented bonus exercises 

Materials
We have used the slides from the graphics website. We have used some slack photos, from other students, to get further.
