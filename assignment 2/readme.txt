Application Class
This class was useless to us, because we have everything in the game class. 
The render method, FOV and keyboard input are in the game class (our application class). 

Extra instructions
The FOV int is in the game class, its max is 179. It causes the screen to look very small obviously, but it works ;)

Bonus exercises 
We haven't implemented bonus exercises 

Materials
We have used the slides from the graphics website. We also used the help of other students (and the student assistants) and professors (mainly via slack).
